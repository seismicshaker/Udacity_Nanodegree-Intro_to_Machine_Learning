# Introduction to Machine Learning Nanodegree
## Unsupervised Learning
### Project: Identify Customer Segments

#### Overview
In this project, I will work with real-life data provided to us by the Bertelsmann partners AZ Direct and Arvato Finance Solution. The data here concerns a company that performs mail-order sales in Germany. Their main question of interest is to identify facets of the population that are most likely to be purchasers of their products for a mailout campaign. I use unsupervised learning techniques to organize the general population into clusters, then use those clusters to see which of them comprise the main user base for the company. Prior to applying the machine learning methods, you will also need to assess and clean the data in order to convert the data into a usable form.

#### Install
This project requires Python 3 and the following Python libraries installed:
- numpy
- pandas
- sklearn
- matplotlib
